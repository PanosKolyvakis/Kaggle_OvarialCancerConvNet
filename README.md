# Kaggle_OvarialCancerConvNet

## Overview

Kaggle_OvarialCancerConvNet is a deep learning project that leverages a pretrained DenseNet transfer model along with additional convolutional layers to identify the types of ovarian cancer from medical scans. The goal of this project is to contribute to the early detection and classification of ovarian cancer through advanced image analysis techniques.

## Features

- Utilizes a pretrained DenseNet transfer model for feature extraction.
- Incorporates additional convolutional layers to fine-tune the model for ovarian cancer classification.
- Developed on Kaggle platform.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Kaggle account
- Required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PanosKolyvakis/Kaggle_OvarialCancerConvNet.git
   cd Kaggle_OvarialCancerConvNet
